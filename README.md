## Dataset Used

* **My Coffe shop Sales.xlsx**
* Sheets included:

  * `Source` — Raw sales data
  * `Analysis` — Pivot tables and aggregated metrics
  * `DashBoard` — Interactive dashboard layout

---

## Questions (KPIs)

* What are the **total orders** and **total sales**?
* Which **coffee types** are the top-selling products?
* How do orders vary by **month**?
* Which **day of the week** has the highest number of orders?
* How are orders distributed across **shifts** (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)?
* What is the contribution of **payment methods** (Card vs Cash)?

---

## Process

* Checked the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* Ensured correct data types and formats (especially date & datetime fields).
* Extracted new time-based columns (Month, Day of Week, Shift).
* Created multiple **Pivot Tables** to answer the defined KPIs.
* Combined all pivots into a single **interactive Excel Dashboard**.
* Added slicers (Date, Coffee Type, Payment Method, Shift) to make the dashboard dynamic.

* Bar chart showing **Top Selling Coffee Types**.
* Column chart for **Orders by Month**.
* Bar chart for **Orders by Day of Week**.
* Distribution of orders by **Shift**.
* Pie chart showing **Payment Method Contribution**.

---

## Project Insight

* **Americano With Milk**, **Latte**, and **Cappuccino** are the most ordered coffee types.
* The highest number of orders occurs during the **Morning shift**, indicating peak business hours.
* Sales are relatively stable across months, with noticeable peaks during certain periods.
* **Card payments** dominate transactions, accounting for more than **90%** of total orders.
* Demand is well distributed across weekdays, with slight increases mid-week.

## Final Conclusion

To improve overall sales performance, the coffee shop should focus on optimizing operations during **morning peak hours** and ensuring high availability of the top-selling coffee items. Since the majority of customers prefer **card payments**, enhancing digital payment experiences and loyalty programs could further increase customer retention. Additionally, promotional offers on slower days or shifts can help balance demand and maximize revenue.
